# Advent of Code 2017 solutions

These are all the solutions for [adventofcode.com] in 2017. Some of them took me a while to get, and three or four expanded my way of thinking, since I'm not from a CS background. Some of this code, be warned, is terrible. My biggest regret is managing to spoiler myself on day 23 pt II.

All code is in Python3 and if you are both annoyed enough to want to and generous enough to do so, feedback is always good!

Mad props to [https://github.com/topaz] for making these puzzles: the care and attention to detail make it a special event.
